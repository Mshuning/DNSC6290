## Intended Use
Use cases that were envisioned during development.
* Primary intended uses
* Primary intended users
* Out-of-scope use cases

## Training Data
May not be possible to provide in practice. When possible, this section should mirror Evaluation Data. If such detail is not possible, minimal allowable information should be provided here, such as details of the distribution over various factors in the training datasets.

## Evaluation Data
Details on the dataset(s) used for the quantitative analyses in the card.
* Datasets
* Motivation
* Preprocessing

## Model Details
Basic information about the model.
* Person or organization developing model: Patrick Hall (jphall@gwu.edu), Shuning Ma (shuningma@gwu.edu)
* Model date
* Model version
* Model type
* Information about training algorithms, parameters, fairness constraints or other applied approaches, and features
* Paper or other resource for more information
* Citation details
* License
* Where to send questions or comments about the model

## Quantitative Analyses
* Unitary results
* Intersectional results

## Factors
Factors could include demographic or phenotypic groups, environmental conditions, technical attributes, or others listed in Section 4.3.
* Relevant factors
* Evaluation factors

## Metrics
Metrics should be chosen to reflect potential realworld impacts of the model.
* Model performance measures
* Decision thresholds
* Variation approaches

## Ethical Considerations

## Caveats and Recommendations
